This is a group project to write a command interpreter to manage our AirBnB objects.The project is the first step towards building our first full webapplication: The AirBnB clone. This step is important because we will use what we build during this project with these future projects:
- HTML/CSS templating
- Database storage
- API
- Front-end integration
